            Rights Nights Mission Statement
					</h3> -->
					<p>Rights Nights is a 5 night Human Rights speaker series leading up to Human Rights Day starting on Monday 5 December through to Friday 9 December. Each night focuses on a different facet of human rights in Australia, in 2016 these are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>the rights of Indigenous Australians;</li>
                        <li>Privacy rights;</li>
                        <li>Women's health rights;</li>
                        <li>Disability rights; and</li>
                        <li>Refugee rights</li>
                    </ol>
          <p>These nightly events will bring together speakers from not-for-profit organisations, academia, advocacy groups, corporates and the public sector to pursue three key objectives:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Providing attendees with information about the status of each of these rights in Australia</li>
              <li>Empowering attendees to advocate for each right, by providing them with ways to promote change</li>
              <li>Equipping attendees with tangible opportunities to put this knowledge into action by linking them with organisations advocating for change in the area.</li>
          </ol>
